# Modern Practical Natural Language Processing

This course will cover how you can use NLP to do stuff.

There will be four videos
1. Overview and Converting Text to Vectors (already released)
  * For finding similar documents
  * "I have this document or text, what others talk about the same stuff?"
  * [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiHB7Ap9wF4)
2. Learning with Vectors and Classification
  * For classifying documents
  * "I need to put these documents into buckets."
  * [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb4L_1QuIo0&fbclid)
3. Visualizing
  * For seeing what document vectors look like in 3D space
  * "I need to quickly see what looks similar to what."
4. Sequence Generation and Extracting Pieces of Information from Text
  * For translation and document summarization, and for pulling out sentences and documents that talk about specific things
  * "I need every mention of a street address or business in Garland, Texas; and I need each document translated to Urdu."


# Additional Details

The idea is we make short videos that focus on the aspects of NLP that currently work well and are useful.

Speech-to-text now works pretty well, so these methods will also be useful for the audio portions of videos.

All code will be available on GitHub here https://github.com/jmugan/modern_practical_nlp

# About Me, Jonathan Mugan
* PhD in Computer Science in 2010 from UT Austin
* Thesis work was about how a robot could wake up in the world and figure out what is going on
* Work at [DeUmbra](https://deumbra.com/) where we build AI for the DoD
  * We also work in healthcare, which I can talk about. A future video (not in this series) will cover how we use graph neural networks to identify who is at risk for opioid overdose
  * Hands-on technical advisor at our sister company [Pulselight](https://www.pulselight.com/)
* Wrote *The Curiosity Cycle: Preparing Your Child for the Ongoing Technological Explosion* http://www.jonathanmugan.com/CuriosityCycle/
* Advisor at [KUNGFU.AI](https://www.kungfu.ai/) 
* Also do independent consulting work

# The Limits of NLP
## Computers can't read
* Reading requires mapping language to internal concepts grounded in behaving in the same general environment as the writer.
  * Computers don’t have those concepts.
  * Example: “I pulled the wagon.” Computers don’t know that wagons can carry things or that pulling exerts a gentle tension to the arm and leg muscles as one walks.

## Computers can't write
* Writing requires mapping internal concepts grounded in behaving in the same general environment as the expected reader.
  * Computers don’t have those concepts

## NLP Works Around Computers Not Having the Experience or Conceptual Framework to Read and Write
* NLP is about how to make natural language amenable to computation even though computers can’t read or write.
* Representing text as *vectors* has transformed NLP in the last 10 years.
* There are also *symbolic methods* that are practically useful; we will cover those too.
